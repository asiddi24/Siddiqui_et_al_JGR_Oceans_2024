# Siddiqui_et_al_JGR_Oceans_2024
Contains scripts to analyze data and create figures in the manuscript. 



Option 1 : To reproduce the manuscript figures, the notebooks need to be downloaded and executed within [Sciserver](https://www.sciserver.org/) to work with the correct (conda) environment. Furthermore, within Sciserver, the notebooks must run within a container created with the `Oceanography 2.3` Compute image. 

Option 2: You can also simply download the contents of this repository into any machine with internet access and `git` install, by executing the following in the command line:

`git clone https://github.com/asiddi24/Siddiqui_et_al_JGR_Oceans_2024.git`

Use the `environment.yml` file as your conda environment. This is the default enviornment used within [Sciserver](https://www.sciserver.org/). It is optimized to work with [Oceanspy](https://github.com/hainegroup/oceanspy/blob/main/sciserver_catalogs/environment.yml)

The folder `figs/` contains static images created in the notebooks.
